# ElectronReactRedux-Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate for the Electron + React + Redux architecture.
This boilerplate is intended to be used as a starting point for a new electron project for a developer with existing knowledge. 

## How to set up the project

First of all we need to __clone__ the repo with the command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:punch92/ElectronReactRedux-Boilerplate.git
```

Then install dependencies with
```bash
$ npm i
```
Now the environment is ready.

Run this two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs for the __transpiling__ of `jsx` and `less` and to __start__ Electron

```bash
$ npm run dev # watch for changes
$ npm run start # start electron
```
