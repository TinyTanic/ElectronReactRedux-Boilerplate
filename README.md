# ElectronReactRedux-Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate for the Electron + React + Redux architecture

## How to set up the project

First of all we need to __clone__ the repo with the command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:punch92/ElectronReactRedux-Boilerplate.git
```

next we need to __install__ globally Gulp and Electron
```bash
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
$ npm install --global electron
```
now the environment is ready.

run this two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs for the __transpiling__ of
* __jsx__ to __js__
* __less__ to __css__

and to __start__ Electron

```bash
$ gulp
$ electron .
```
